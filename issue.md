### 🐛 Bug / Redundancy Report

The file `auth.js` currently exists in the repository but appears to be **unused** throughout the project. Additionally, it does **not contribute** to the authentication flow of the web app and contains either placeholder or non-functional logic.

---

### 🔍 Current Behavior:
- The file is not imported or used in any component.
- Its existence may lead to confusion for contributors trying to understand the auth flow.
- Keeping unused files increases maintenance overhead.

---

### ✅ Suggested Improvement:
- Remove the `auth.js` file from the project.

This would help clean the codebase and improve maintainability.
